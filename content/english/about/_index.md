Hoi! I'm a dedicated researcher and engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology.

I am a Master's student majoring in Computer Science now at the University of Southern California(! **Fight On** !) just graduated in May 2025. During the two years here, I focused on robotics research. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Dalian University of Technology, where I developed a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals and honed my skills in software development, machine learning, and data analysis.

My current research focus around the exciting combination of Deep Learning based methods and traditional robotics engineering, with particular expertise in ML-driven robotic systems and algorithm-hardware integration. During my second year of Master's program, I further explored multimodal sensing frameworks with advanced manipulation algorithms for real-world deployment. Through extensive hands-on experience with multiple robot arms and dexterous hands, I tried to bridge theoretical algorithms with practical hardware implementation, including robotic platform deployment and hardware troubleshooting.

My simulation experience extends to IsaacLab and MuJoCo, enabling me to develop robust systems that perform effectively in both virtual and physical environments. I've published multiple robotics conference papers on dexterous manipulation with multimodal perception and temperature-aware robotic grasping systems deployed on robotic platforms.

I'm particularly fascinated by how multimodal data can enhance model self-awareness and enable rapid self-iterative fine-tuning. This emerging area represents a crucial step toward truly autonomous robotic systems that can adapt and improve their performance through continuous learning from diverse sensory inputs.

As someone who deeply values hands-on experience, I firmly believe that genuine robotics researchers must possess strong hardware interaction and debugging skills. I'm convinced that meaningful algorithmic research should emerge from real-world engineering challenges, where practical insights from physical implementation can inform and enhance theoretical developments.

This research builds upon my previous work in computer vision and 3D pointcloud matching. I've contributed to enhancing computer vision models through biological structure research, drawing inspiration from nature to improve artificial perception systems. One of my notable projects involved developing a rotation-resistant point cloud contour algorithm. This novel approach, based on 3D-CNN and Transformer architectures and inspired by cognitive science principles, aimed to improve the robustness of 3D object recognition systems.

In addition to my research endeavors, I bring substantial experience in software engineering and full-stack development. I'm proficient in a range of technologies including Go, React, Bootstrap, Vue.js, Spring, and MySQL. This diverse skill set allows me to bridge the gap between research and practical applications, often deploying complex systems on cloud platforms such as Aliyun, Amazon EC2, and Google Cloud.

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo and push technological boundaries. Whether it's advancing the field of robotics through multimodal perception systems, exploring model self-awareness and adaptive learning, optimizing AI algorithms for real-world deployment, or developing robust software solutions, I'm committed to bringing innovation and rigorous problem-solving skills to the table.
