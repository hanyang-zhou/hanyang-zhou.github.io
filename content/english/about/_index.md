Hoi! I'm a dedicated researcher and engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology.

I am a Master's student majoring in Computer Science now at the University of Southern California(! **Fight On** !) just graduated in May 2025. During the two years here, I focused on robotics research. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Dalian University of Technology, where I developed a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals and honed my skills in software development, machine learning, and data analysis.

Through my Master's program, I have gained extensive hands-on experience with multiple robot arms and dexterous hands, bridging theoretical algorithms with practical hardware implementation. This includes robotic platform deployment, hardware troubleshooting, and system optimization. I have published multiple robotics conference papers on dexterous manipulation with multimodal perception and temperature-aware robotic grasping systems deployed on robotic platforms. I have experience with IsaacLab and MuJoCo, enabling me to develop robust systems that perform effectively in both simulated and real-world environments. I believe that meaningful robotics research emerges from real-world engineering challenges, where practical insights from physical implementation inform and enhance theoretical developments.

I am particularly fascinated by how multimodal data can enhance model self-awareness and enable rapid self-iterative fine-tuning. This emerging area represents a crucial step toward truly autonomous robotic systems that can adapt and improve their performance through continuous learning from diverse sensory inputs.

My research foundation builds upon previous work in computer vision and 3D point cloud processing. One notable project involved developing a rotation-resistant point cloud contour algorithm based on 3D-CNN and Transformer architectures, inspired by cognitive science principles to improve the robustness of 3D object recognition systems.

Beyond research, I bring substantial experience in software engineering and full-stack development. I'm skilled in a range of technologies including Go, React, Bootstrap, Vue.js, Spring, and MySQL. This diverse tech set allows me to bridge the gap between research and practical applications, deploying complex systems on cloud platforms such as Aliyun, Amazon EC2.

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo and push technological boundaries. Whether it's advancing the field of robotics through multimodal perception systems, exploring model self-awareness and adaptive learning, optimizing AI algorithms for real-world deployment, or developing robust software solutions, I'm committed to bringing innovation and rigorous problem-solving skills to the table.
