Hoi! I'm a dedicated researcher and software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology.

I am a Master student major in Computer Science now at the University of Southern California(! **Fight On** !), where I specialized in artificial intelligence and robotics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Dalian University of Technology, where I developed a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals and honed my skills in software development, machine learning, and data analysis.

My current research focus lies at the exciting intersection of deep learning and traditional control theory. I'm working on optimizing robot control in complex task environments by integrating these two powerful paradigms. This innovative approach aims to leverage the adaptability and pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning models while harnessing the stability and reliability of classical control methods. By fusing these techniques, we're striving to develop more robust, efficient, and versatile robotic systems capable of handling intricate real-world scenarios.

This research builds upon my previous work in computer vision and AI. I've contributed to enhancing computer vision models through biological structure research, drawing inspiration from nature to improve artificial perception systems. One of my notable projects involved developing a rotation-resistant point cloud contour algorithm. This novel approach, based on 3D-CNN and Transformer architectures and inspired by cognitive science principles, aimed to improve the robustness of 3D object recognition systems.

In addition to my research endeavors, I bring substantial experience in software engineering and full-stack development. I'm proficient in a range of technologies including Go, React, Bootstrap, Vue.js, Spring, and MySQL. This diverse skill set allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, often deploying complex systems on cloud platforms such as Aliyun, Amazon EC2, and Google Cloud.

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo and push technological boundaries. Whether it's advancing the field of robotics, optimizing AI algorithms, or developing robust software solutions, I'm committed to bringing innovation and rigorous problem-solving skills to the table.
